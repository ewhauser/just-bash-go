# gbash

A deterministic, sandbox-only, bash-like runtime for AI agents, implemented in Go.

Shell parsing is delegated to [`mvdan/sh`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh), with project-owned virtual filesystem, registry-backed command execution, policy enforcement, and structured tracing layers around it. Commands never fall through to host binaries, and network access is off by default. Originally inspired by [Vercel's `just-bash`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash).

> This is beta software. It is likely that additional security hardening is needed. Use with care.

- 60+ built-in commands with GNU coreutils flag parity ([compatibility matrix](https://ewhauser.github.io/gbash/compat/latest/))
- Optional allowlisted network access via `curl`
- Persistent sessions with shared filesystem state across executions
- Host directory mounting with read-only overlay for real project workspaces
- Execution budgets — command count, loop iterations, glob expansion, stdout/stderr limits
- Structured trace events for debugging and agent orchestration
- WebAssembly support — runs in the browser ([demo](./examples/website/))

## Public Packages

- `github.com/ewhauser/gbash`: the core Go runtime and embedding API
- `github.com/ewhauser/gbash/contrib/...`: optional Go command modules
- `@ewhauser/gbash-wasm/browser`: the explicit browser entrypoint for the `js/wasm` package. It is versioned in-repo today; npm publishing remains disabled in the release workflow for now.
- `@ewhauser/gbash-wasm/node`: the explicit Node entrypoint for the same `js/wasm` package.

## Installation

Library:

```bash
go get github.com/ewhauser/gbash
```

CLI:

```bash
go install github.com/ewhauser/gbash/cmd/gbash@latest
```

Prebuilt archives are also available on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ewhauser/gbash/releases).

## Quick Start

Try it with `go run` — no install required:

```bash
go run github.com/ewhauser/gbash/cmd/gbash@latest -c 'echo hello; pwd; ls /tmp'
```

```text
hello
/home/agent
```

Everything runs inside a virtual filesystem — nothing touches your host.

## Usage

### Go API

Use `gbash.New` to configure a runtime and `Runtime.Run` for one-shot execution.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ewhauser/gbash"
)

func main() {
	gb, err := gbash.New()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	result, err := gb.Run(context.Background(), &gbash.ExecutionRequest{
		Script: "echo hello\npwd\n",
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("exit=%d\n", result.ExitCode)
	fmt.Print(result.Stdout)
}
```

```text
exit=0
hello
/home/agent
```

### Persistent Sessions

Use `Session.Exec` when you want multiple shell executions to share one sandbox filesystem.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ewhauser/gbash"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	gb, err := gbash.New()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	session, err := gb.NewSession(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	if _, err := session.Exec(ctx, &gbash.ExecutionRequest{
		Script: "echo hello > /shared.txt\n",
	}); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	result, err := session.Exec(ctx, &gbash.ExecutionRequest{
		Script: "cat /shared.txt\npwd\n",
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Print(result.Stdout)
}
```

```text
hello
/home/agent
```

### CLI

Pipe a script to the CLI to execute it inside the sandbox:

```bash
printf 'echo hi\npwd\n' | gbash
```

```text
hi
/home/agent
```

When stdin is a terminal, the CLI starts an interactive shell automatically:

```bash
gbash
```

You can also force interactive mode explicitly:

```bash
printf 'pwd\ncd /tmp\npwd\nexit\n' | gbash -i
```

The interactive shell reuses one sandbox session and carries forward filesystem and environment state, but does not provide history, line editing, or job control.

For host-backed CLI runs, you can switch the filesystem mode explicitly:

```bash
gbash --root /path/to/project --cwd /home/agent/project -c 'pwd; ls'
```

`--root` mounts a host directory read-only at `/home/agent/project` under an in-memory writable overlay. `--cwd` sets the initial sandbox working directory.

## Configuration

### Filesystem

Most callers should use one of these entry points:

- `gbash.New()` — default mutable in-memory sandbox
- `gbash.WithWorkspace(root)` — real host directory mounted read-only under an in-memory overlay
- `gbash.WithFileSystem(gbash.ReadWriteDirectoryFileSystem(...))` — just-bash-style mutable host-backed root
- `gbash.WithFileSystem(gbash.CustomFileSystem(...))` — seeded or custom backends

Mount a host directory as a read-only workspace overlay:

```go
gb, err := gbash.New(
	gbash.WithWorkspace("/path/to/project"),
)
```

This mounts the host directory read-only at `/home/agent/project`, starts the session there, and keeps all writes in the in-memory upper layer.

For full control over the mount point or host-file read cap:

```go
gb, err := gbash.New(
	gbash.WithFileSystem(gbash.HostDirectoryFileSystem("/path/to/project", gbash.HostDirectoryOptions{
		MountPoint: "/home/agent/project",
	})),
)
```

If you want writes to persist directly back to the host directory instead of landing in the in-memory overlay, use the read/write helper:

```go
gb, err := gbash.New(
	gbash.WithFileSystem(gbash.ReadWriteDirectoryFileSystem("/path/to/project", gbash.ReadWriteDirectoryOptions{})),
	gbash.WithWorkingDir("/"),
)
```

This mode maps the host directory to sandbox `/`, so it is best suited to compatibility harnesses and other opt-in developer workflows.


### Network Access

Network access is disabled by default. Enable it to register `curl` in the sandbox.

For simple URL allowlisting, use `WithHTTPAccess`:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ewhauser/gbash"
)

func main() {
	gb, err := gbash.New(
		gbash.WithHTTPAccess("https://api.example.com/v1/"),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	result, err := gb.Run(context.Background(), &gbash.ExecutionRequest{
		Script: "curl -o /tmp/status.json https://api.example.com/v1/status\ncat /tmp/status.json\n",
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Print(result.Stdout)
}
```

For fine-grained control over methods, response limits, and private-range blocking, use `WithNetwork`:

```go
gb, err := gbash.New(
	gbash.WithNetwork(&gbash.NetworkConfig{
		AllowedURLPrefixes: []string{"https://api.example.com/v1/"},
		AllowedMethods:     []gbash.Method{gbash.MethodGet, gbash.MethodHead},
		MaxResponseBytes:   10 << 20,
		DenyPrivateRanges:  true,
	}),
)
```

For full transport control in tests or embedding, inject your own `Config.NetworkClient`.

## Security Model

- The shell only sees the filesystem and runtime configuration you provide.
- Command execution is registry-backed. Unknown commands never execute host binaries.
- Network access is off by default. When enabled, requests are constrained by allowlists and runtime limits.
- The default static policy applies execution budgets such as command-count, loop-iteration, glob-expansion, substitution-depth, and stdout/stderr capture limits.
- Trace events capture command execution, file access and mutation, and policy denials for debugging and agent orchestration.

This is not a hardened sandbox. If you need stronger containment against denial-of-service or runtime bugs, use OS- or process-level isolation around it. For a detailed threat analysis, see [THREAT_MODEL.md](./THREAT_MODEL.md).

## Supported Commands

The default registry includes commands for file ops, text processing, archival, and execution. Use `gbash.DefaultRegistry()` to start from the stock builtin set and register custom commands on top.

| Category | Commands |
|---|---|
| File and path | `basename` `cat` `chmod` `chown` `cp` `dirname` `du` `file` `find` `ln` `link` `ls` `dir` `mkdir` `mv` `readlink` `rm` `rmdir` `stat` `touch` `tree` |
| Search and text | `base32` `base64` `column` `comm` `cut` `diff` `grep` `head` `join` `nl` `paste` `printf` `rev` `rg` `sed` `seq` `sort` `split` `tac` `tail` `tee` `tr` `uniq` `wc` |
| Archive | `gzip` `gunzip` `tar` `zcat` |
| Environment and execution | `bash` `date` `echo` `env` `expr` `false` `help` `id` `md5sum` `printenv` `pwd` `sh` `sha1sum` `sha256sum` `sleep` `timeout` `true` `uptime` `which` `xargs` `yes` |
| Network (when configured) | `curl` |

Many commands are ported from [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) and have full GNU flag parity. See the current [compatibility matrix](https://ewhauser.github.io/gbash/compat/latest/).

### Contrib Commands

Optional commands live in [`contrib/`](./contrib/) as separate Go modules so the core library stays dependency-light. They are not registered by default.

| Command | Module | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| [`awk`](./contrib/awk/) | `github.com/ewhauser/gbash/contrib/awk` | [`benhoyt/goawk`](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk) |
| [`jq`](./contrib/jq/) | `github.com/ewhauser/gbash/contrib/jq` | [`itchyny/gojq`](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq) |
| [`sqlite3`](./contrib/sqlite3/) | `github.com/ewhauser/gbash/contrib/sqlite3` | [`ncruces/go-sqlite3`](https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3) |
| [`yq`](./contrib/yq/) | `github.com/ewhauser/gbash/contrib/yq` | [`mikefarah/yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) |

Use `github.com/ewhauser/gbash/contrib/extras` to register all contrib commands at once:

```go
import "github.com/ewhauser/gbash/contrib/extras"

gb, err := gbash.New(gbash.WithRegistry(extras.FullRegistry()))
```

See the [`custom-zstd`](./examples/custom-zstd/) example for how to register custom commands.

## Shell Features

Shell parsing and execution are delegated to `mvdan/sh/v3`, with project-owned filesystem, command, policy, and trace layers around it.

The runtime supports a practical shell subset for agent workflows, including:

- pipelines and redirections
- variable expansion and command substitution
- conditionals and loops
- shell functions and common builtins handled by `mvdan/sh`
- virtual `cd` and `pwd` behavior against the sandbox filesystem
- nested `bash` and `sh` execution inside the same sandbox session

It is intentionally not a full Bash reimplementation. It does not aim to provide full GNU Bash compatibility, readline-style UX, shell history, job control, or host TTY emulation.

## Default Sandbox Layout

Each fresh session starts with a Unix-like virtual layout:

- home and default working directory: `/home/agent`
- scratch directory: `/tmp`
- command directories: `/usr/bin` and `/bin`
- default `PATH`: `/usr/bin:/bin`

Those command paths are virtual stubs used for shell resolution. Command implementations still come from the Go registry, not the host filesystem.

## Development

The repo is a committed Go workspace plus a pnpm workspace. The root module has the public `gbash` package, CLI, internal runtime implementation, and core commands. [`contrib/`](./contrib/) and [`examples/`](./examples/) remain separate Go modules to keep optional dependencies out of the core import graph, while [`packages/`](./packages/) contains publishable JavaScript packages such as [`@ewhauser/gbash-wasm`](./packages/gbash-wasm/).

`make build`, `make test`, and `make lint` cover the Go modules. See the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) for additional targets.

Use `npm exec --yes pnpm@10.10.0 -- install --frozen-lockfile` at the repo root when you need the JavaScript workspace dependencies, or `pnpm install` if you already manage pnpm locally.

The repo uses both [`go.work`](./go.work) and committed child-module `replace` directives. `go.work` keeps the workspace coherent at the repo root, and the child-module replaces make each nested module buildable on its own while still declaring real tagged dependencies for published consumption.

Use `make fix-modules MODULE_VERSION=vX.Y.Z` when preparing the next coordinated root, contrib, and `@ewhauser/gbash-wasm` release line. That updates the nested module requirements, refreshes the local replaces, updates the npm package version, and runs `go mod tidy` in each child Go module.
